# lx-rental

This resource is a script that lets players rent a vehicle and choose what vehicle and payment they want, in return they get papers for the vehicle which they can use to prove that they've rented the vehicle. 

for ox_inventory:
```
    ['rentalpapers'] = {
        label = 'Rental Papers',
        weight = 65,
        stack = false,
        close = true,
        description = 'Vehicle rental papers.',
        consume = false,
    },
```
